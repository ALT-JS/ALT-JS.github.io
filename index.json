This SimpleNet model is a straightforward convolutional neural network designed for facial keypoint detection. It takes a single-channel 224×224 grayscale image as input and applies a series of four convolutional blocks—each block consisting of convolution, batch normalization, ReLU activation, max pooling, and dropout—to progressively extract and compress features, reducing the image size down to roughly 13×13. The resulting feature map is then flattened and passed through three fully connected layers, with the final layer outputting 136 values corresponding to 68 (x, y) keypoints. The network also uses Xavier initialization for the FC layers to improve convergence during training.\nTraining and validation loss curves Visualizations on test images Pros and Cons SimpleNet is easy to design and fast to run, but it doesn’t converge well and the result isn’t OK to use in real applications because the keypoints aren’t real to be actual human faces.\nPart 2: Transfer Learning for Keypoint Detection Implementation details This model is a modified ResNet-18 adapted for facial keypoint detection on grayscale images. It takes a 1-channel image as input by replacing the first convolutional layer with a new one that accepts a single channel, and its weights are initialized by averaging the pretrained RGB weights. The final fully connected layer is replaced with a new linear layer that outputs 136 values corresponding to 68 (x, y) keypoints. Additionally, the model supports an optional parameter to freeze the backbone for transfer learning, ensuring that only the final regression head is trained if desired. I set 10 epoches for the first stage where the pretrained backbone is frozen and only train the new layers, and I finetuned the whole model for another 10 epoches where all the parameters are active. Both stages has a learning rate of 5e-4.\nTraining and validation loss curves Visualizations on test images Pros and Cons The Resnet18 yields better performance compared to the previous SimpleNet and thanks to utilizing existing pretrained backbone, it’s not too hard to design the network. Although it costs more time compared to the SimpleNet, its results show way less flaws and I would say it’s applicable for natural human face keypoint detection.\nPart 3: Heatmap-based Keypoint Detection Implementation details This UNet model is an encoder-decoder architecture designed for keypoint heatmap prediction, taking a single-channel image and outputting 68 heatmaps. In the encoder (or “down” part), the network applies several sequential convolutional blocks—each consisting of two convolution layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation—to progressively extract features while preserving spatial information, and uses max pooling to reduce spatial resolution after each block, storing intermediate outputs as skip connections. The bottleneck further processes the compressed representation with a deeper convolutional block that doubles the feature channels, while the decoder (or “up” part) upsamples the bottleneck output using transposed convolutions and concatenates it with the corresponding skip connections (after resizing if needed), followed by additional convolutional blocks to refine the combined features. Finally, a 1×1 convolution projects the features to the desired number of output channels (68), with each channel representing the predicted heatmap for a facial keypoint.\nFor the keypoint extraction function, it extracts keypoint coordinates from predicted heatmaps by processing a batch of heatmaps with shape [B, K, H, W], where B is the batch size, K is the number of keypoints, and H and W are the heatmap height and width. For each sample in the batch and for each keypoint channel, it flattens the heatmap into a 1D tensor and uses argmax to find the index of the highest activation, which is assumed to correspond to the keypoint location. The index is then converted back into two-dimensional coordinates by computing the row (y-coordinate) as the quotient of the index divided by W and the column (x-coordinate) as the remainder of that division. The coordinates for each keypoint are collected per sample and ultimately returned as a tensor containing all predicted keypoints.\nTraining and validation loss Visualizations on test images Click to zoom in.\nPros and Cons The UNet result is very satisfying and it converges really fast, you can get decent workable model in 2~3 epoches, and its validation loss is also low. The cons is that UNet in my approach is sensitive to learning rate, in my test 1e-4 yields nice and consistent results.\nDiscussion I started out to have really random and bad results with the heatmaps and the keypoints extracted from the keypoints.

Started out with masses and springs, I build grid of point masses and implemented 3 type of constraints(structual, shearing and bending) presented as strings between the point masses. Next, I implemented easy simulation with classic Newton’s law F = ma, Hooke’s law for forces on masses, verlet integration for new point mass positions and Provot’s study to ensure spring’s length is at most 10% greater than its rest_length at the end of any time step. Then it’s the collision handling with spheres and flat surfaces. Followed with self-collision handling which makes the falling fabric more realistic so that it won’t overlap unnaturally. Finally, I use GLSL to implement a lot of different vertex shaders and fragment shaders: diffuse shading, blinn-phong shading, texture mapping, bump mapping, displacement mapping and mirror-like environment-mapped reflection.\nPart 1: Masses and springs Some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json You can also treat the picture w/ all constraints below as the third view.\nView 1 View 2 The wireframe screenshots w/ all constraints w/o shearing w/ only shearing Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration Experiments with some the parameters in the simulation Spring constant ks When the ks is very small, the cloth behaves very “loose” and tiny little force will make the whole cloth moves and “shivers”. When the ks is very big, the cloth behaves very “tight” and sags less than smaller ks, the whole cloth will reach to a stop faster than smaller ks.\nks = 50000 ks = 5 Density With higher density, the cloth sags more than lower density when at full stop, also, I noticed that when they are dropping down, higher the density, slower the speed, and also the deformation in the middle of the cloth is bigger. This is because the density cause the point mass to be heavier/lighter.\ndensity = 100 og density density = 1 Damping Bigger damping value results in much stable movement when falling down, which indicates that the delta of point masses location doesn’t change dramatically. From the picture, very low damping value results in the cloth behaves jumping around actively, whereas higher damping value initially controls the cloth movement and then even the sagging speed is lower.\nbig damping value super small damping value scene/pinned4.json results All default. Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects Implementation of collisions Sphere collisions I first calculate the distance between the pointmass and origin of the sphere’s surface, if it’s landing on it then we just return, if not, I compute the correction vector from the tangent (origin + (dir / dist) * radius) minus last position, scaled down by friction.\nPlane collisions The function first computes the signed distances of the point mass’s last and current positions from the plane by taking the dot product of the difference between the positions and a reference point on the plane with the plane’s normal. If the product of these distances is negative, it indicates that the point mass has crossed the plane. The function then calculates the fraction along the point mass’s trajectory where the collision occurs and determines the exact collision point (referred to as “tangent”) on the plane. Depending on whether the point mass was above or below the plane, it adjusts the collision point by a small offset to avoid numerical issues. Finally, it computes a correction vector that accounts for friction, updating the point mass’s position so that it lies on or near the plane after the collision.\nscene/sphere.json results ks = 500 og ks(ks = 5000) ks = 50000 The higher the ks, the cloth seems more “extended” and harder to deform, which matches what ks contributes to the property of the cloth.\nCloth on plane result Part 4: Handling self-collisions Implementation of self-coliision To implement self-collision for the cloth, I used a spatial hashing approach to efficiently detect and resolve collisions between point masses. First, the build_spatial_map function creates a spatial map by iterating over all point masses and hashing their positions into discrete grid cells using the hash_position function, which computes a unique float identifier for each 3D box volume based on the cloth dimensions. Then, in the self_collide function, for a given point mass, I retrieve nearby candidate point masses from the spatial map (i.e., those that share the same hash key). For each candidate (excluding the point mass itself), I calculate the distance between their positions; if it is less than twice the cloth thickness, I compute a corrective displacement vector to push them apart. The average of these correction vectors, scaled by the simulation step size, is then added to the point mass’s position, effectively resolving the self-collision.\nSelf-collision at different time early stage middle stage near final stage Varied density and ks og …","date":1742256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742256000,"objectID":"fbdfd643ee680c26bbb3a6458e7a73d2","permalink":"https://alt-js.github.io/post/184pj4/","publishdate":"2025-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/184pj4/","section":"post","summary":"Part 0: Project overview In this project, I’ve implemented a real-time simulation of cloth using a mass and spring based system.

First, I implemented ray generation and the intersection between ray and objects/scene. Next, I implemented the BVH splitting and intersection detection. Then, I implemented direct illumination(zero/one bounce lights) and global illumination(multi-bounce lights w/ w/o russian roullete) to actually render the whole scene with path tracing. Finally, I implemented adaptive sampling to reduce the noise of monte carlo path tracing.\nPart 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection Ray generation walkthrough \u0026amp; primitive intersection pipeline I first calculate the bottom left and the top right corner of the sensor/image space coordinates, which helps me to determine the coordinates in the camera space with left multiplcation of the c2w matrix. Then with the origin pos and the previously calculated coord as direction vector(since the origin is [0,0,0] and it’s numerically the same for the coords and the vector), we can generate the correct ray.\nPrimitive is the bridge between geometry processing and the shading subsystem. It contains all the things including bbox, intersect, has_intersection and bsdf. For intersections, we use has_intersection to determine whether it’s intersected or not and use intersect to actually change the intersection distance, the normal vector, and the bsdf.\nTriangle intersection algorithm walkthrough For the intersect and has_intersection, I used the Moller-Trumbore algorithm to compute them. We compute two edges of the triangle. Compute the determinant det to check if the ray is nearly parallel. Compute u and v(barycentric coordinates) to ensure the intersection lies within the triangle. Compute t, the intersection distance along the ray. And finally check if t is within the ray’s valid range (min_t to max_t). The function intersect basically determine whether has_intersection is true or not and change the primitives and the properties mentioned above(intersection distance, normal vector, bsdf).\nSome results CB spheres cow Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy BVH construction algorithm walkthrough First, compute the bounding box (BBox) of all primitives in the given range [start, end). Then, I choose the best axis to split: compute the bounding box centroid for each primitive. Select the axis with the largest extent (X, Y, or Z) and split at the centroid median to achieve balanced partitions. The primitives are sorted first and partitioned into left and right subsets. Finally, recursively call function and construct BVH for left and right subsets and return the newly created BVHNode.\nSome results CB Lucy Max Planck More on BVH acceleration First, here’s more result on the BVH rendering(left) and the comparison between the non-BVH. You can see that there’s basically no difference between them.\nPeter w/ BVH Peter w/o BVH But the rendering time, as shown in the picture below, have significant difference. One is 0.0653 second, and the other takes 166.5520 seconds to finish. Nearly 300x faster.\nPart 3: Direct Illumination Direct Lighting functions walkthrough Uniform Hemisphere Sampling In the loop of num_sample samples, we sample from hemisphereSampler, then we create a new ray with in point hit_p and the epsilon constant for avoiding numerical presision issues and direction sampled earlier. If the ray intersects we calculate the L_out of the ray. Finally we divide the sum of all the things above with pdf and the num_samples.\nImportance Sampling Lights FOr importance sampling, we sample all the lights directly After we calculate the hit point hit_p, we directly sample a light ray from it. If we cast a ray in this direction and there is no other object between the hit point and the light source, then we know that this light source does cast light onto the hit point. After the judge, we still do the same thing as above(divide the sum of all the things above with pdf and the num_samples).\nSome results Hemisphere uniform sampling Direct importance sampling Hemisphere uniform sampling Direct importance sampling Direct comparison Up 1 Down 16 Up 4 Down 64 Conclusion Uniform hemisphere sampling distributes samples evenly over the hemisphere, leading to significant variance in Monte Carlo integration when evaluating lighting contributions, especially in scenes with strong directional lighting. This results in more noise and slower convergence. In contrast, importance sampling strategically places more samples in directions where the light source contributes most to the radiance, reducing variance and improving efficiency. This method converges faster, producing smoother and more accurate results with fewer samples.\nPart 4: Global Illumination Indirect lighting function walkthough We get the one bounce radiance first, then, we sample a new f using the outgoing direction of the last ray.

In this project, we started out from the basic Bezier curve and de Casteljau algorithm, and extend it to 2D surfaces. We also made a fully functional mesh “editor” that does edge flipping, edge splitting and mesh upsampling. The most challenging parts were ensuring correct pointer assignments in the edge splitting and properly handling newEdge in Loop subdivision.\nSection 1: Bezier Curves and Surfaces Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision Briefly explain de Casteljau’s algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves. De Casteljau’s algorithm is used to determine the point on the Bezier curve of a certain number of points. For $n$ points, we iteratively use linear interpolation to determine $n-1$ points, until we only have one point, which is $p_{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$. This particular point will be on the Bezier curve of $p_{0}$ and $p_{n-1}$ from the original $n$ points.\nI wrote a seperate lerp function and iterate it through all the points. The lerp function is defined as: $$\\text{lerp}(p_i, p_{i+1}, t) = (1 - t) p_i + t p_{i + 1}$$\rThe new points generated is the one-step result of all the original points.\nThe Bezier curve with 6 control points The six pictures below shows the 5 steps of evaluation of the original 6 control points and the final bezier of the points.\nIn this picture I changed the position of the points and the $t$ value. A slightly different Bezier curve Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces. The de Casteljau’s algorithm naturally extends to Bezier surfaces by applying the same interpolation process in two directions $u$ and $v$. For each row of control points $P(i,j)$, apply the de Casteljau algorithm recursively to compute an intermediate set of points at parameter $u$, reducing the row into a single point. Once you have the intermediate points from the previous step, apply de Casteljau along the $v$-direction to interpolate these points and obtain the final surface point $S(u,v)$.\nI modified the lerp function to make it accept Vector3D inputs and outputs, and the evaluate process is just call evaluate1D on controlPoints, and return with the results of the previous loop being run in the evaluate1D again but with a different interpolation parameter. The evaluate1D function also loops through points with evaluateStep but only returns the 0-th dimension of the result.\nThe teapot result the screenshot of bez/teapot.bez evaluated by my implementation Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals. Started with one halfedge, we iterate through every halfedge. For every halfedge, we extract the previous, current, next vertex position, and calculate the cross product of vectors defined by current and next vertex and current and previous vertex. We add up all the cross products and restore it to unit vector as the output.\nThe teapot result default flat shading Phong shading Part 4: Edge Flip Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation. I first determine every possible element of a unit pair of triangles, then, I changed the relations of every possible related halfedge using setNeighbors function, and assign the faces and vertices with the correct halfedge in the end. Here’s a picture that contains all the notations I’m using in my code. Flip edge draft The teapot result The original teapot The teapot woth some flipped edges The freakin’debug journey From the draft, you probably noticed that I initially wrote the vertex $c$ and $d$ in the wrong place. Because I sticked to my draft so closely, I kept checking the errors in my code, not the draft itself:(.\nPart 5: Edge Split Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation I first did all the things similar to the filpEdge function(determine possible elements), then I created new edge, face and halfedges. For the new edgeHere’s a picture that contains all the notations I’m using in my code. Split edge draft Some teapot result The original teapot The teapot with some split edges The teapot with some splits and filpped edges Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision I first compute new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh, using the weighted average formula given in the question. Mark each vertex as being a vertex of the original mesh, and compute the updated vertex positions associated with edges new positions. Then loop through the mesh to split edges and setting new halfedges generated, as well as filp any new edge that connects an old and new vertex to make the mesh more “organized”.
